Collection of fortune files for Brian Eno's "Oblique Strategies" 
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Strategies)

If you have an edition that's not currently on here, send me an email: 
hermann.kaser@gmail.com

To use, copy the files to the folder where the normal fortune data files are 
stored and then add a call to fortune at the end of your .bashrc to get it to 
show up on login.

Example for Ubuntu:
$ sudo cp oblique* /usr/share/games/fortunes/
$ echo "fortune oblique-ed4" >> ~/.bashrc
